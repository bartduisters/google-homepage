This is my first ever solo project in development.
currently following the odin project to learn the skills of a full stack developer. I was always interested in IT, so now its time to do something with this interest of mine.
For a mini-project on TOP we had to copy the google homepage. You can read all about the assignment here:

I did the best i could at this stage of my learning curve/knowledge. im not a 100% satisfied with the outcome and there are still things i don't fully understand but once i get more practice i think ill get it (some day :-))

Anyone who takes his or her time to look into my project feel free to leave some comments.
